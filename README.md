A collection of open source Burp Extensions, written in Python

## Blackhole Hosts
Blackhole Hosts is an extension that drops proxy requests to certain hosts, and logs those dropped requests. This allows you to effectively blackhole hosts, while not modifying Burp's (included or excluded) scope.
